This is concerning the repository branch : 104/User-Authentication-Authorization

This is the initial commit that focuses on register, Login, logout. The models created support basic 
Authentication and authorization.

Authentication: this means that the User can register an account, Log into an account and Log out of an account.

Authorization: this means that the system does not support anonymous users, hence a login decorator on the getArticles function
this ensures that the basic CRUD operations are performed by authorized users.



NOTE:
This is an inital commit, more complex operations will follow.
the Models, Forms, Templates and Views are created to Support User-Authentication-Authorization, in the meantime
and by no means seek to provide a detailed, actual and final workings of the system.
